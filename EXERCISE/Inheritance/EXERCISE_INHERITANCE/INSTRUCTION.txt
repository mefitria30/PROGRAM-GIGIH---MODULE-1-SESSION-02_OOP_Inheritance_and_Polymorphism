Exercise

Now, let's help Jin a little bit. As a hero, every time he is attacked, Jin has 80% chance to deflect the attack. When he deflects an attack, he takes 0 damage and his hit point are not reduced.

The rest of the rules are still the same with the previous problem statement

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The result suppose looks like this:

> ruby app.rb

Jin Sakai has 100 hitpoint and 50 attack_damage

Khotun Khan has 500 hitpoint and 50 attack_damage

Jin Sakai attacks Khotun Khan with 50 attack_damage
Khotun Khan has 450 hitpoint and 50 attack_damage

Khotun Khan attacks Jin Sakai with 50 attack_damage
Jin Sakai deflects the attacks.
Jin Sakai has 100 hitpoint and 50 attack_damage

[repeat until one of Jin or Khotun dies]

[in the case that Jin dies]
Jin Sakai dies
